# Shadow Handling (Client)

Server may return `shadow=true` for anti-farm/anomaly.
Client rules:
- No ban messaging.
- Keep gameplay identical.
- Never show crypto celebration.
- Rewards shown as credits/cosmetics/attempts (server already downgraded).
- Leaderboard may be accepted but de-ranked server-side.

This keeps honest players safe and drains farms of value.
